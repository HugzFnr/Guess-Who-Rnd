# Guess-Who-Rnd

An ugly looking version of the board game "Guess Who ?" with less characters and with only a solo mode. But characters are randomly 
generated (98 different different characters exist) so every game is brand new ! Ask questions (in french only, sorry) then click on a character to make a guess (2 attempts max).

### Context

I made this game for my computer science option project in high school (year 2015).

We didn't use any versioning tool at that time, but luckily I found the code in some old folders.

### Demonstration

Here is a 1 minute long video demonstration of the game that I commented in french : https://youtu.be/9PlXIUx84gg

One day I shall subtitle it in english, promised.
